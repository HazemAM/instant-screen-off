Instant Screen-off
==================

Instant Screen-off is a dead-simple module for the Xposed framework that disables the screen-off animation. For more information, refer to this post: [Disabling Android's Screen-off Animation](http://exp.hazemam.com/post/screen-off).

The module should work well on AOSP-like ROMs, with Lollipop or later.
